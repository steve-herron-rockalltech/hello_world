Upgrading COLLATE using WebLogic
================================

Before upgrading the web application, COLLATEâ€™s Oracle database must be upgraded, and COLLATE artifacts must be updated. 
For more information, see :ref:`upgrade-the-database` and :ref:`update-artifacts`.

This section describes the process of upgrading a deployment of the COLLATE web application using 
WebLogic Server Administration Console. After reading this document, you will know the steps involved in updating artifacts 
and installing the latest .war file.

.. tip::
   For the version of WebLogic supported, see :ref:`environment-prerequisites`. 


Deploying COLLATE in Production mode
------------------------------------

When performing either a greenfield or an upgrade deployment of COLLATE, in a WebLogic environment, 
ensure that WebLogic is set to operate in *Production mode*, even if the deployment is just to test the COLLATE application.


Setting WebLogic to operate in Production mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set the Weblogic application server to operate in production mode, run one of the following commands:

.. rubric:: Command for LINUX environments

.. code:: 

    nohup $DOMAIN_HOME/startWebLogic.sh production &

.. rubric:: Command for Windows environments

.. code:: 

    start %DOMAIN_HOME%\startWebLogic.cmd production

   of the following commands:

   .. code:: 

       cd $DOMAIN_HOME/bin
       nohup sh stopWebLogic.sh &
